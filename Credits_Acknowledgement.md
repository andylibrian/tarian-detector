# Tarian Detector Credits & Acknowledgements

We extend our deepest gratitude to the entire open-source eBPF community. Your unwavering dedication and commitment to open-source software development have been instrumental in the evolution and success of Tarian Detector.

We owe a special debt of gratitude to several key projects. Their insights and innovations have significantly shaped Tarian Detector.

## Acknowledgements

- **_[Falco](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco):_** Falco is a cloud-native security tool that monitors anomalous activity in nodes and containers using eBPF. Falco helps us detect malicious behavior, configuration changes, and compliance violations in real time1. Falcoâ€™s flexible rules engine and integration with various systems have enabled us to leverage eBPF for threat detection and mitigation.

- **_[KubeArmor](https://github.com/kubearmor/KubeArmor):_** An initiative that offers runtime protection for Kubernetes and other cloud workloads. Your effort to improve the security of cloud-based systems has greatly inspired our work.

- **_[Tetragon (from Cilium)](https://github.com/cilium/cilium):_** The innovative Tetragon component provides powerful real-time, eBPF-based security observability and runtime enforcement. The component's capabilities have been invaluable to our understanding of eBPF-based security.

- **_[Tracee](https://github.com/aquasecurity/tracee):_** Tracee uses eBPF technology to tap into the system and provides access to hundreds of events that help understand system behavior. The principles and techniques incorporated in Tracee have been instrumental in shaping the functionalities of Tarian Detector.

We express our heartfelt appreciation for the influence and inspiration these projects have bestowed upon us. They epitomize the remarkable achievements the open-source community can accomplish through collaboration and knowledge sharing.

In closing, we are profoundly grateful for the dynamic open-source community that envelops and uplifts us. We eagerly anticipate continuing our journey of learning from and contributing to this extraordinary community.
